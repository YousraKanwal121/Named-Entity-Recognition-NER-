# 🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy

A Custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) system developed using **Python** and **spaCy** to identify named entities from article-based datasets. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** where users can enter text and receive predicted entities in real time.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that identifies and classifies important entities in text such as **Person, Organization, Location, Date, Money, and more**.

This project was developed using an article dataset. After training the custom spaCy model, a Streamlit dashboard was created that allows users to enter any sentence and instantly view the detected entities.

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Collect article dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Prepare training annotations
4. Train a custom spaCy NER model
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Save the trained model
7. Build an interactive Streamlit dashboard
8. Predict entities from user input

---

## 🎯 Entity Types

The model can identify entities such as:

- PERSON
- ORG (Organization)
- GPE (Location)
- DATE
- MONEY
- CARDINAL
- TIME
- EVENT
- PRODUCT
- LAW
- NORP
- FAC
- LOC
- WORK_OF_ART

---

## 🚀 Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard allows users to:

- Enter any sentence or paragraph.
- Predict named entities instantly.
- Display detected entities with their labels.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for text analysis.

Example:

**Input**

```
Apple CEO Tim Cook visited London on 20 June 2025.
```

**Output**

| Entity | Label |
|---------|-------|
| Apple | ORG |
| Tim Cook | PERSON |
| London | GPE |
| 20 June 2025 | DATE |
